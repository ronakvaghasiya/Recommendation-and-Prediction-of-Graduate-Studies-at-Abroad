"It is a pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Aayushi Birla, a Computer Engineering student here at the Chandubhai S. Patel Institute of Technology. In our association of three years I have not only been a tutor but also a guide to her and it is with my absolute confidence in her that I recommend her as an ideal student for the  Graduate Program at your University.

Having known her for over two years now as a student, I have seen in her  hunger to grasp all that is there on offer. As a teacher I have taught her various subjects such as Data Analysis and Algorithm, Theory of Computation and Compiler Construction over a course of time. She has always been there in each lecture in the front row listening intently to what was being taught, trying to understand with curiosity. She has never accepted things until she has understood the concept being taught, a trait that is very rarely seen today. She is inquisitive and innovative in her approach and always came up with insightful questions that proved useful for her and others in the class to build clarity on the subject. Her presence is not just limited to classroom activities, but extends beyond it in all kinds of fields. She has actively participated in inter-college cultural festivals for over two years now. She has helped arrange expert lectures in the institute and also actively participated in industry visits. It is this omnipresence that gives her personality that edge needed to make a mark on the map of the world.

As a seventh semester student she is learning Compiler Construction  under me currently. Her hard work is evident in her efforts to understand the underlying principles of the subjects and her good performance in the assignments. Her intent to prove her mettle is very evident and will never fail as she believes in herself. 

Mature and career oriented, she has a strong sense of responsibility to her educational and professional objectives. Her organizational and team skills are par excellence. Punctual, disciplined and ethical, Aayushi has developed very good leadership qualities, and is today a confident young computer engineer as a result of her technical prowess as well as her general demeanor. I am sure that Aayushi Birla will bring in laurels to your college on the course and also her professional career thereafter. I do reiterate my recommendation for her to join your MS in Computer Engineering this year. I also wish her a bright future.",5
"Penning down this letter of recommendation for Mr. Bhuvan Soni is an immense pleasure as I have known him for over last 4 years now and thus I am aware of his abilities. Bhuvan was a part of my class on Design and Analysis of Algorithm in 5th semester and Modeling Simulation and Operational Research in 5th semester. I was his mentor and guide for final year project on Virtual Classroom. 
The reason I gladly took up the task of writing this letter of recommendation is his understanding of the underlying concepts and exceptional clarity of thoughts. His innate passion to excel at any task undertaken has resulted in good standing in his class semester after semester.  Not just this, he has also maintained a position amongst the good students of the university. He is capable of putting in the requisite hard work, has consistently striven for improvement in his work, and has intellectual aptitude and determination.

"I am writing this letter of recommendation in authority as a Professor at Madhuben & Bhanubhai Patel Women's Institute of Engineering, Gujarat Technological University. This recommendation letter is being written for Mansi D. Vaghasiya who was my student from Computer& Science department.

I know her personally after observing her in my classes for Software Engineering and Advance Java in sixth and seventh semester respectively. 

I have observed that during classes, Mansi always looks to supplement her reading and learning within the topics with application based queries and is keen to explore the future path that the technology is expected to take. I believe this is an important trait for one who wants to study at the masters’ level.

Mansi was interested in learning and looked forward to implement her academic knowledge in practical applications. This reflected in all her projects. I would like to mention about one ofthe projectsshe had submitted on Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Doctor’ Network (a professional networking community for healthcare professionals). This project like her other ones was an excellent application of theories learnt. She explored different factors of SRS including Use Cases, Functional & Non-Functional requirements, Software design constrains, Analysis models and Change management process.  

I have often noticed that Mansi always researched in depth, understood the essence of the given topic exquisitely and was able to explain the same.

us I have taught her Wireless communication in 7 th semester and Data Communication And
Networking in 8 th semester. I have also guided her for project on Green House Monitoring And
Controlling using Wireless Communication .
Over the past years I have been impressed by Kinjal on a number of counts. She not only has
excellent grasp of the subject matter but is quick to relate and understand new topics and their
relevance. This is particularly evident in her research projects and seminar presentations. The work
presented by her was not only well researched but unique in terms of various viewpoints put forth by
her. This showed her keen interest in getting to the root of the subject and doing a full justice to
work on hand.
Kinjal’s academic record puts her in top 10 % of students at our university. What is even more
appealing is that along with excellent academics she was able to devote time, energy and priority to
all of her research assignments. I believe her research efforts and research potential when combined
with her excellent grasping ability and inherent knowledge of the subject will result in her scaling all
peaks of excellence.
I have keenly observed Kinjal’s work in group where she naturally assumes the role of a leader.
This is again due to her wealth of knowledge, a high level of motivation and complete dedication to
work. Her exceptional communication skills and team spirit are also responsible for her overall
success.
It has recently been told to me that Kinjal wishes to apply for a master&#39;s program in one of the
leading Canadian universities. I fully back her endeavor. I have no doubt that she will not only
succeed but also make us proud through her future achievements. I hereby strongly recommend her
application for admission to the graduate program at your esteemed university.",4
"It is a genuine pleasure and honour for me to recommend Ms. Kinjal Chaudhary, who was

"Teaching dedicated students is always a pleasure and so it was teaching Miss. Drisha Patel
who had been with us for four years. She has recently graduated with a bachelor’s degree in
computer engineering from our college. On academic front her performance is good, though
she did show her potential in the last semester where she scored first class, but overall I know
her as one of our most prolific students in terms of attempting and completing challenging
assignments.  These have been in areas of programming, networking, researching and using
different tools and technologies, and presenting his work in class.
Her work includes a project on Online News Portal. This was done in android.  For the project
she was able to use his expertise in the field and come up with a program.  Another unique
project was done by her in the area of swimming fish. This was done through C programming
and involved computer graphics. She has presented seminars on 5 th Generation Technology
and Software Requirements Specification on Ambulance Dispatch System.
Apart from research and developmental work, Drisha Patel has impressed me with his
knowledge in evolving technologies and her ability to grasp and use them for problem solving
purposes.
